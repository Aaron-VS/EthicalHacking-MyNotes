# 💥 Zero-Day Attacks

Welcome to the **Zero-Day Attacks** knowledge repository. This document explains what zero-day vulnerabilities and attacks are, how they work, and how to defend against them. Use this repo for educational, research, or awareness purposes.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This content is for **educational and ethical purposes only**. Do not attempt to exploit or use zero-day vulnerabilities on systems you do not own or have permission to test.

## 📖 What is a Zero-Day Attack?

A **Zero-Day Attack** (also written as **0-day**) is a cyberattack that targets a **previously unknown software vulnerability** — a flaw that has not yet been discovered, reported, or patched by the software vendor.

Since there’s no available fix at the time of the attack, zero-day exploits are **extremely dangerous** and often used in:
- Espionage
- Ransomware
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

---

## 🧠 Why "Zero-Day"?

The term "Zero-Day" refers to the fact that developers have had **zero days** to fix the flaw because it was **not known publicly** before being exploited.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. A vulnerability exists in software or hardware.
2. An attacker discovers it before the vendor does.
3. The attacker writes an exploit for the flaw.
4. The exploit is used in an attack — often stealthily.
5. Eventually, the vendor learns of the issue and develops a patch.

## 🎯 Common Targets

- Web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Office software (MS Office, Adobe Reader)
- Email clients
- Mobile apps and platforms (Android, iOS)
- IoT devices and embedded systems
- Enterprise VPNs, firewalls, and APIs

---

## ⚠️ Why Are Zero-Day Attacks Dangerous?

- **No Patches Exist:** No defense at the time of attack.
- **Stealthy:** Often undetected until after the damage is done.
- **Expensive and Hard to Defend:** Traditional antivirus may not catch it.
- **Used by State Actors:** In cyberwarfare and espionage.

## 🛠️ Notable Real-World Examples

| Incident | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Stuxnet (2010)** | Used four zero-day exploits to sabotage Iranian nuclear centrifuges. |
| **Chrome Zero-Day (2022)** | Google patched multiple 0-days actively exploited in the wild. |
| **Kaseya VSA (2021)** | Zero-day used in ransomware supply chain attack affecting thousands. |

## 🛡️ Defense Against Zero-Day Attacks

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Apply Updates Quickly** | Install patches as soon as they're available. |
| **Use Behavior-Based Detection** | EDR/XDR tools analyze abnormal behavior, not just known threats. |
| **Zero Trust Architecture** | Assume breach and verify every request. |
| **Segment Networks** | Limit lateral movement within systems. |
| **User Training** | Reduce risk of phishing and malware. |
| **Threat Intelligence Feeds** | Stay updated on emerging threats. |

---

## 🧩 Terminology Recap

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Zero-Day Vulnerability** | A flaw unknown to the vendor/public. |
| **Zero-Day Exploit** | A tool or technique that takes advantage of that flaw. |
| **Zero-Day Attack** | The use of a zero-day exploit in a real-world scenario. |
